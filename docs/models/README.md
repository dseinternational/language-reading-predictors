# Model inventory

> [!NOTE]
> Drafted by a LLM-based AI tool (Claude Code/Opus 4.8).

A catalogue of every model in this study — what it is, what outcome it targets, and
what question it answers. It is a map, not a results document: read the per-model
report (`docs/models/{model_id}/index.qmd`) and `METHODS.md` for findings, diagnostics,
and the full methodology.

The project uses a deliberate **two-step methodology** (see `METHODS.md`):

1. **Layer 1 — gradient-boosting discovery** (`src/language_reading_predictors/models/`,
   ids `lrp-rli-gbg-NNN` / `lrp-rli-gbl-NNN`). LightGBM models that _rank_ which predictors help out-of-sample
   prediction of each outcome, read with permutation importance and SHAP. Associational
   and exploratory — never causal.
2. **Layer 2 — Bayesian statistical models**
   (`src/language_reading_predictors/statistical_models/`, family-prefixed ids). PyMC
   models that estimate interpretable estimands with quantified uncertainty and, where
   the DAG supports it, a causal effect. All use a Beta-Binomial likelihood on bounded
   post-score counts via a logit linear predictor.

Both layers are built against the **revised causal DAG**
(`dag/dag-language-reading.dagitty`, revised 2026-07-10). The single most important reading
rule across the whole collection: **only the randomised contrast is causal.** In Layer 2
that is the intervention-group term (`τ`) in the ITT/DiD/gain-factor families. Every
skill→skill coupling, mechanism slope, mediator→outcome path, and dose–response is a
latent-ability-confounded **adjusted association**, never "X drives Y". Positive `τ` =
intervention benefit (`G = 2 − group`).

Counts are of base models on `main` (114 statistical models in total, from `definitions.MODEL_REGISTRY`). Layer-2 selection variants (`…b` / `…base` / `…d`)
are included in the family counts and listed in the per-family tables below.

## Outcome symbols (Layer 2)

Layer-2 models refer to outcomes by short symbols; the bounded count maximum (`n`) is the
Beta-Binomial trial ceiling.

## Layer 1 — Gradient-boosting discovery (`lrp-rli-gbg` / `lrp-rli-gbl`)

**Purpose.** For each outcome, fit a tuned LightGBM (GroupKFold by `subject_id`) and rank
predictors by out-of-fold permutation importance + mean |SHAP|, reading direction and
consistency from the SHAP beeswarm. This is the discovery layer that tells the Bayesian
work _which_ predictors are worth modelling. Two model families per outcome: **gain**
(predicting a `_GAIN` change score) and **level** (predicting a concurrent same-wave
level).

Gain-model rankings are near-noise (baseline-driven regression to the mean); level-model
rankings are largely concurrent same-construct correlation — read both under those
caveats (`notes/202606231100-gb-selected-features-tables.md`). This layer uses full-set
_ranking_ (`scripts/rank_predictors.py`, issue `#116`): hard feature selection was retired
in Phase D. The same-skill sibling contrast is exposed via the ranking's
`ranking_excluding_same_skill.csv` rather than per-model variants.

### Core outcomes (reading / language outcomes)

| Gain              | Level             | Outcome                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-012` | `lrp-rli-gbl-012` | Word reading (`ewrswr`)                     |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-006` | `lrp-rli-gbl-006` | Expressive vocabulary (`eowpvt`)            |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-009` | `lrp-rli-gbl-009` | Letter-sound knowledge (`yarclet`)          |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-005` | `lrp-rli-gbl-005` | Receptive vocabulary (`rowpvt`)             |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-014` | `lrp-rli-gbl-014` | Basic concept knowledge (`celf`)            |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-015` | `lrp-rli-gbl-015` | Receptive grammar (`trog`)                  |

| `lrp-rli-gbg-010` | `lrp-rli-gbl-010` | Phoneme blending (`blending`)               |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-008` | `lrp-rli-gbl-008` | Expressive grammar (`aptgram`)              |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-007` | `lrp-rli-gbl-007` | Expressive information (`aptinfo`)          |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-016` | `lrp-rli-gbl-016` | DEAP fine articulation (`deappfi`)          |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-002` | `lrp-rli-gbl-002` | Taught expressive vocabulary (`b1extau`)    |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-001` | `lrp-rli-gbl-001` | Taught receptive vocabulary (`b1retau`)     |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-003` | `lrp-rli-gbl-003` | Not-taught receptive vocabulary (`b1rent`)  |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-004` | `lrp-rli-gbl-004` | Not-taught expressive vocabulary (`b1exnt`) |
| `lrp-rli-gbg-011` | `lrp-rli-gbl-011` | Phonetic spelling (`spphon`)                |

The last four rows are the #116 Phase-B additions completing the 13 priority
outcomes; their hyperparameters were MAE-tuned by Optuna on the full predictor
set (150 trials, seed 47; #169), and they do not yet have bespoke report
templates (Phase C).
`spphon` is heavily floored, so its gain ranking is expected to be near-noise.

### Speech, verbal-memory and language-sample measures (`lrp-rli-gbg`/`lrp-rli-gbl` 017–028)

Exploratory predictability discovery for measures that had only ever been predictors,
to inform the DAG's measurement side.
LSAM and `deapp_c` are level-only.

## Layer 2 — Bayesian statistical models

One module per model, each defining a `SPEC = ModelSpec(...)` and a `fit(config)`. Eight
factory/pipeline families keyed by `ModelSpec.kind`. Shared priors, HSGP helpers, the
g-formula, and the floor rule live in the package; each fit writes `trace.nc`,
`diagnostics_summary.json` (the convergence gate), per-family CSVs, and diagnostic plots
to `output/statistical_models/models/{model_id}-{config}/`.

### ITT suite — `lrp-rli-itt-001–lrp-rli-itt-028` (`kind="itt"` / `"joint"`)

**Purpose.** The headline causal layer: the randomised intention-to-treat effect `τ` of
group assignment on each outcome. Under the revised DAG the ITT is identified by the
**empty adjustment set** (the own baseline and linear age enter as _precision_ terms
only); attendance/dose is never conditioned on (a collider). Heavily-floored outcomes
(`P`, `N`) take a pre-specified floor rule: a binary off-floor primary estimand plus a
flagged graded secondary. Design notes: `notes/202606251321-lrpitt-suite-design.md`,
`notes/202606251124-lrpitt-floored-outcomes-nonword-spelling.md`.

### Gain factors — `lrp-rli-gf-001–lrp-rli-gf-011` (+ `…b`) (`kind="gain_factors"`)

**Purpose.** A DAG-focused ANCOVA on each outcome's period gain (post-score given its own
pre-score), stacking every on-intervention and untreated period with a child random
intercept — a partial, shrunken stand-in for between-child heterogeneity, **not** a
control for latent ability. The randomised on-intervention term is the **only** causal
coefficient, and its probability/items-scale marginal effect is averaged over the
**period-1** (randomised) transition only; own baseline, age, cognitive ability (block
design), the upstream DAG skill baselines (`skill_symbols`), the revised-DAG non-measure
confounders hearing/speech/phonological memory (`adjust_for`), and focal interactions are
explicit _adjusted associations_. Adjustment sets were re-derived against the revised DAG
in #247. The `…b` variant is treated-only (gains while on intervention). Design note:

| `lrp-rli-gf-011` | `N`     | `L`, `B` (off-floor Bernoulli likelihood) | `SP`, `RW`                 | —                 |

### Level factors — `lrp-rli-lf-001–lrp-rli-lf-011` (`kind="level_factors"`)

**Purpose.** The companion _levels_ view of each outcome (the score at each timepoint, no
own baseline), with group×time and ability×time as per-timepoint coefficient vectors. Only
the t2 group contrast is a clean randomised effect; later timepoints are post-crossover and
flagged as associations. Each outcome carries the same revised-DAG exogenous confounders
(`adjust_for`: hearing/speech/phonological memory) as its gain-factor sibling, but **no**
measure-skill adjusters — in a levels model a skill's contemporaneous level is a
post-treatment mediator of the group×time effect (#247). Outcomes mirror the gain-factor
family: `lrp-rli-lf-001` `W`, `02` `R`, `03` `E`, `04` `L`, `05` `P` (off-floor), `06` `B`,
`07` `F`, `08` `T`, `09` `TR`, `10` `TE`, `11` `N` (off-floor).

### Waitlist-crossover / difference-in-differences — `lrp-rli-did-001–lrp-rli-did-012` (+ `lrp-rli-did-107`) (`kind="did"`)

**Purpose.** A within-person replication of the randomised ITT, using the waitlist arm's
crossover: each child is partly their own control, with the immediate arm anchoring the
time/maturation trend (Beta-Binomial logit so the ceiling is respected). A second,
non-randomised view that triangulates the ITT. The heavily floored outcomes (`P`, `N`)
instead take the suite's **off-floor floor rule** — a Bernoulli on the off-floor
indicator — so their `delta` is the within-person effect on the log-odds of coming off
the floor (an off-floor risk difference on the items scale), mirroring their ITT siblings.

### Aligned per-protocol — `lrp-rli-al-001–lrp-rli-al-008` (+ `lrp-rli-al-101`) (`kind="aligned"`)

**Purpose.** An onset-aligned, per-protocol single gain: both arms aligned by intervention
onset (immediate t1→t3, waitlist t2→t4) into one cross-sectional Beta-Binomial ANCOVA per
child. The cohort contrast is **not** randomised (confounded by age-at-onset and timing),
so _no_ term is causal — every coefficient is an association. Design note:
`notes/202606261343-lrpal-aligned-design.md`. Outcomes: `lrp-rli-al-001` `W`, `02` `R`, `03` `E`,
`04` `L`, `05` `P` (off-floor), `06` `B`, `07` `F`, `08` `T`; **`lrp-rli-al-101`** adds a
cumulative-session dose sensitivity term (a collider — sensitivity only).

### Mechanism — `lrp-rli-mech-056–lrp-rli-mech-058`, `lrp-rli-mech-071–lrp-rli-mech-073` (`kind="mechanism"`)

**Purpose.** The adjustment-set dose-response of one measured skill on another across all
phases, with subject random intercepts and optional linear moderation. Every slope is an
**adjusted association** (latent-ability confounded), not a causal effect.

| Model                         | Path    | Purpose                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lrp-rli-mech-056`            | `R → W` | Receptive vocabulary → word reading                                                                   |
| `lrp-rli-mech-057`            | `E → W` | Expressive vocabulary → word reading                                                                  |
| `lrp-rli-mech-058`            | `L → W` | Letter-sound knowledge → word reading                                                                 |
| `lrp-rli-mech-071`            | `L → W` | Letter sounds → word reading, linear moderation by expressive vocabulary `E`                          |
| `lrp-rli-mech-072` / `72base` | `L → N` | Code-based route: letter sounds moderated by blending `B` → decoding (with / without the interaction) |
| `lrp-rli-mech-073` / `73base` | `L → W` | Letter sounds → word reading, moderated by age (with / without the interaction)                       |

### Mediation — `lrp-rli-med-059`, `lrp-rli-med-062`, `lrp-rli-med-064` (`kind="mediation"` / `"mediation_multi"`)

**Purpose.** g-formula NDE/NIE decomposition: how much of the intervention's word-reading
gain runs through a given skill. Not point-identified under the revised DAG (latent ability +
same-wave mediator/outcome) — reported as triangulation, leading with the robust quantity.

| Model             | Purpose                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lrp-rli-med-059` | Single-mediator: word-reading gain via letter-sound knowledge `L`                                     |
| `lrp-rli-med-062` | Reading-route decomposition: code-based-route (`L` + blending `B`) vs lexical share                   |
| `lrp-rli-med-064` | Two-mediator split: `L` vs expressive vocabulary `E` (joint indirect + path-specific `NIE_L`/`NIE_E`) |

### Predictor / within-child dynamics — `lrp-rli-adj-065`, `lrp-rli-lcsm-067`, `lrp-rli-dose-077` (+ variants)

**Purpose.** Three complementary, explicitly **associational** views of word-reading
progress that sit outside the randomised families.

| Model              | Kind            | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lrp-rli-adj-065`  | `adjusted`      | Between-child: which wave-1 baseline skills go with more subsequent word-reading gain, mutually adjusted                                                                                                        |
| `lrp-rli-lcsm-067` | `lcsm`          | Within-child latent change-score: prior-wave letter sounds `L` and vocabulary `E` as predictors of reading _change_                                                                                             |
| `lrp-rli-dose-077` | `dose_response` | Period-resolved observational dose-response of intervention sessions → word reading; `lrp-rli-dose-177` adds an ability-adjusted sensitivity, `lrp-rli-dose-277` is the pooled (no-period-variation) comparator |

`lrp-rli-dose-077`'s dose terms are observational (sessions = a DAG collider as exposure): an adjusted
within-child association, never "more sessions cause more gain". Only the randomised ITT/DiD
contrasts carry the causal claim.

### Joint growth curves — `lrp-rli-gc-069`, `lrp-rli-gc-070` (`kind="growth"`)

**Purpose.** Characterise the **longitudinal trajectories** of the five verbal/reading
measures (`R`, `E`, `T`, `W`, `L`) across the four RLI waves and ask whether **baseline
non-verbal ability** (`blocks`, WPPSI Block Design, t1-only, complete for all 54 children)
predicts their _shape_ — the descriptive Q5 answer (issue #187). Each measure gets a
per-child latent logit intercept + linear age slope (masked Beta-Binomial); `gamma`
(non-verbal → growth _rate_) is the headline estimand, `delta` the effect on baseline
_level_.

| Model            | Kind     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lrp-rli-gc-069` | `growth` | Independent-core: per-measure trajectories; baseline non-verbal ability → each measure's growth rate (`gamma`) + level (`delta`)                                                                               |
| `lrp-rli-gc-070` | `growth` | Adds a rank-1 shared growth-tempo factor: do the measures grow together, and does non-verbal ability predict the common tempo? `LOO(lrp-rli-gc-069 vs lrp-rli-gc-070)` tests whether the factor earns its keep |

`gamma`/`delta` are **adjusted, `GA`-confounded associations, never causal** — block design
is an off-DAG ability proxy (revised DAG) and the child random intercept only _partially_
adjusts. Descriptive natural-history, `n≈54` (wide intervals). Byrne-cohort replication is a
gated follow-up (unconfirmed `bpvs`/`basmat` ceilings; `basmat` is wave-3+, so no baseline).
