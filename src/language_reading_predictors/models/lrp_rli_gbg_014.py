lrp-rli-gbg-014: Predictors of basic concept knowledge gains (CELF).

``LRPGBG14`` is the exploratory model for basic concept knowledge
gains (``celf_gain``). The ``celf`` score is drawn from the
Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals Preschool 2nd Ed
(Wiig, Secord & Semel 2006) and in this study only the basic-
concept-knowledge subtest (18 linguistic concepts) was
administered — so ``celf`` is a lexical/semantic concept measure,
NOT a grammar measure (the grammar measures in this study are
``trog`` for receptive grammar and ``aptgram`` for expressive
grammar).

LRPGBG14 is Huber-tuned on the full
:attr:`Predictors.DEFAULT_GAIN` set (which already includes
``celf`` as a level predictor — the GainModel's auto-include is a
no-op here), with no outlier exclusion, designed to rank predictors of basic concept knowledge gains.
