LRPGBG16: Predictors of DEAP fine-articulation gains.

``LRPGBG16`` is the baseline exploratory model for DEAP fine-
articulation gains (``deappfi_gain``). ``deappfi`` is a
percentage-scale articulation measure from the Diagnostic
Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (Dodd et al., 2006) —
the proportion of sounds correctly produced when the child is
asked to name pictures. ``deappfi`` specifically scores the
*final* consonant of each word (distinct from ``deappin``
initial and ``deappvo`` voicing).

The target is nearly symmetric but with a heavy two-sided
spread (``deappfi_gain`` min −56.9, max 56.0, median 0.01,
mean 0.84, std 13.28, skewness −0.32, with **~48% negative**
and ~2% zero observations, n ≈ 152). **Heavy regression from
the ceiling is the dominant story** — children at the top of
the scale tend to drop back between timepoints while those at
the floor improve.

DEAP measures have been used as predictors across every other
model in the suite but never as targets until LRPGBG16/22.
