    and the items scale (the average marginal effect × ``n_trials``) as a **median**
    with a 50 % and a ``ci_prob`` (default 89 %) equal-tailed interval, plus:

    - ``pd`` — ``P(effect > 0)``, the probability of direction;
    - ``prob_benefit_ge_delta`` — ``P(items effect > δ)``, the probability of a
      *meaningful* benefit, where ``delta`` is the minimally-important difference

    ``term`` / ``varying_term`` / ``G`` select the randomised effect: the ITT suite
    uses the defaults (``tau`` with the age-varying ``tau_i``, ``G`` the arm

    (sign-vs-size, the median convention, the δ choice).

    ``direction_from_ame`` (default False → ITT behaviour unchanged): when True the
    direction fields (``pd`` / ``direction_label`` / ``favoured_direction*``) are taken
    from the probability-scale AME rather than the coefficient, and ``pd_coef`` records
    the coefficient direction. The gain-factor family sets this because its treatment
